# D8

The D8 is a commercial aircraft configuration conceived by Prof. Mark Drela that promises dramatic fuel efficiency benefits. In the Hoburg Research Group, we are formulating the Transport Aircraft System OPTimization (TASOPT) framework developed by Prof. Drela in a Signomial Program (SP), which will allow us to perform sensitivity analyses on the D8 to quantify the benefits of the configuration with respect to mission parameters.
